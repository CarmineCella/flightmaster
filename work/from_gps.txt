Here’s another method;

Distance & Azimuth from Position to Destination

Distance = 90 – Sin-1(sin(Destination Latitude) x sin(Your present Latitude) + cos(Destination Latitude) x cos(Your present Latitude) x cos(Difference in Longitude between Your Location and Destination Location)

Multiply answer by 60 to get Nautical miles.

Another way

Distance = 60 x Cos-1(sin(Destination Latitude) x sin(Your present Latitude) + cos(Destination Latitude) x cos(Your present Latitude) x cos(Difference in Longitude between Your Location and Destination Location)

Azimuth to Destination

NOTE- LHA= Present Longitude – Destination Longitude

Z = tan-1(sin (LHA) / (cos (LHA) x sin(Your present Latitude) – cos(Your present Latitude) x tan(Destination Latitude))

Then to put Z into the right quadrant, apply the following rules-

If answer is negative, add 180º to Z
LHA is NEGATIVE if it’s less than 180º .

Another way

tan-1(sin(LHA) / (cos(Present Latitude) x tan(Destination Latitude) – (sin(Present Latitude) x cos(LHA))
-continued on next page-
If LHA is greater than 180 it’s treated as a negative quantity.
If the Azimuth angle as calculated is negative, add 180 to it.
